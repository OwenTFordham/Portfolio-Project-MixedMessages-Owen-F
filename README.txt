This is for the Codecademy project MixedMessages where running the code will output a random message
I have decided to combine multiple individual words to create a truly random message focused on a pokemon theme
Please have a look and leave any feedback in the codecademy forums https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/feeback-request/794844
To run the program either copy the code into an editor and run it or run it using Node on git bash
